# Introduction to the Builder Pattern

This is the content for an evolving lecture in the Deep Dive Coding bootcamps. Initially, this 
lecture was given to students in the _Fullstack_ (HTML, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL) bootcamp, so the 
code examples here are in PHP.

Lecture notes: [Markdown](lecture.md), [PDF](Introduction%20to%20the%20Builder%20Pattern%20in%20PHP.pdf).
